# Creating C++ Interfaces for Fluid Dynamics Simulation
This project is to demonstrate Fluid Dynamics simulation using C++. 

# Pre-requistite(s):
1) Computational Fluid Dynamics (Advanced Mechanical Engineering)
2) Linear Algebra, ODEs and PDEs, Numerical Integration 
3) C++ Applicative programming (OOPS Concepts)
4) Data structure and Algorithms

# Tools Required
1) Visual Studio For C++ (For Code Creation, Edition, and to Compile and Build)
2) GitHub Extension for Visual Studio (For Source Code Management (SCM))
3) Paraview for visualization

# Technology Used:
1) C++ 
2) Microsoft - Component Object Modeling (COM)
3) CFD Discretization

To Build:
----------------
1.  Start Microsoft Visual Studio and select **File** \> **Open** \> **CreatingInterfaceGitHub**.
2.  Go to the directory named for the Geometry, and double-click the Geometry.sln file.
3.  Press F5 or use **Build** \> **Build Solution** to build the solution.

    The executable will be built in the default **\\bin** or **\\bin\\Debug** directory.

# Initial State:
![Density](Output/Density.JPG "Initial Condition Screenshot")
A rectangular domain (or a tank) of size 3 x 2 meters containing a total of 300 x  200 particles.
Particles are initially distinct into two different regimes representing water (on the left-bottom) with density 1000 kg/m^3 
and air (on the remaining space) with 1/1000 th of density of water respectively.
